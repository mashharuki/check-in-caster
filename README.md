Introducing Check-In Caster: A fresh, engaging way to discover and share your favorite spots, directly integrated with Farcaster.  We're building a geolocation primitive with “Foursquare” for the Farcaster ecosystem, enabling users to 'Check-in and Earn' rewards with ease.

Here's how it works:

1. **Simple Check-ins**: You can check in on “Check-in Caster client app” by just casting on Warpcast and mentioning @checkin with google map link. 
2. **Interactive Engagement**: After checking in, the Check-In Caster bot replies with a Farcaster Frame that highlights reviews and offers a bookmarking feature, letting you dive deeper into each location right within Warpcast—no need to switch apps.
3. **Rewards & Recognition**: Earn unique location badges as NFTs and tokens for each check-in, adding both value and a financial incentive to exploring.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Our client app supports login with your Farcaster or social accounts via Privy. Your feed will display others’ check-ins and keep a history of your journeys on your profile.
5. **Automatic Check-ins via POAP**: For POAP holders, Check-In Caster suggests check-ins based on your past event participations, leveraging Airstack to fetch your POAPs. It's an automated way to keep your check-in streak alive without manual inputs.

Check-In Caster is not just an app; it's a gateway to reliving your best moments, discovering new ones, and earning rewards along the way.

We're building an interoperable foundation for restaurants, stores, and landmarks to create location-based loyalty programs. This helps make Check-In Caster sustainable in the long run with relevant ongoing engagement and incentives with network effect accruing value to users.
